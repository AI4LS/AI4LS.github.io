Logic synthesis is a process by which an abstract specification of desired circuit behavior, typically at register transfer level (RTL), is turned into a design implementation in terms of logic gates, typically by a computer program called a synthesis tool. Common examples of this process include synthesis of designs specified in hardware description languages, including VHDL and Verilog.[1] Some synthesis tools generate bitstreams for programmable logic devices such as PALs or FPGAs, while others target the creation of ASICs. Logic synthesis is one aspect of electronic design automation.

The vision of our AI4LS team is to enhance and revolutionize logic synthesis with AI including AI driven efficient and effective operators, sequence tuning, and physical aware synthesis algorithms.

We cover the research and development of the whole stack techniques of Logic Synthesis and AI driven circuit representation learning and applications. Any interested students, researchers, and engineers are welcome to contact us via ai4eda at huawei dot com and join us in Beijing, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, London, and Montreal.
