Logic synthesis is a process by which an abstract specification of desired circuit behavior, typically at register transfer level (RTL), is turned into a design implementation in terms of logic gates, typically by a computer program called a synthesis tool. Common examples of this process include synthesis of designs specified in hardware description languages, including VHDL and Verilog.[1] Some synthesis tools generate bitstreams for programmable logic devices such as PALs or FPGAs, while others target the creation of ASICs.

Logic synthesis is an important step in the front-end of the electronic design automation (EDA) tool chain. It has the largest freedom to modify the circuit or netlist structures, which are critical for optimize Performance, Power, and Area (PPA) within given time budget. Most synthesis algorithms work on graph with different abstraction level, which are NP-hard. Therefore, many well-designed heuristic methods are proposed to get acceptable but sub-optimal solutions. 

Physical Design, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing have witnessed the great success of AI. How to further push the boundary of logic synthesis with AI to meet higher PPA or runtime requirements is an interesting but challenging problem.

The vision of our AI4LS team in Huawei Noah&apos;s Ark Lab is to enhance and revolutionize logic synthesis with AI including data driven efficient and effective operators, sequence tuning, and physical aware synthesis algorithms.

We cover the research and development of the whole stack techniques of Logic Synthesis, data driven circuit representation learning and applications.
