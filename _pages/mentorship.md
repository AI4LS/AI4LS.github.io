I am looking for motivated undergrads to work with on several compilers and libraries projects. If you are interested, please contact me.

### Why seeking mentorship / undergrad research experience?

Here is a non-exhaustive list of benefits I can imagine that you may gain.

- Enhance engineering skillsets by solving real problems, which is the most effective way
- Check whether a research career or an engineering career better fits you
- Check whether this direction is what you desire most to pursue in your career
    - Remember that your work is non-binding. It is reasonable and not uncommon for an undergrad to try several directions to define his career. 
- Exchange ideas and learn from your mentor and other collaborators
- Get advice from your senior peers applying to grad school, coursework, or anything
- Gain advice and recognition from active professors and/or full-time researchers in the projects

From my side, when seeking to become a mentor, I expect the following benefits.

- Exchange ideas; improve thinking and thoughts on my projects through discussing and advocating.
    - Even learning by teaching is more effective than learning by oneself.
- Get some manpower while my advisor is not admitting new graduate students
- Joyfulness when tutoring my younger peers
- Through managing projects, prepare myself for a senior position in my career in the long run
