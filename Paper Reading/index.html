        <p class="card-text" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Three local scalable and effective logic optimization operators are proposed to optimize AIGs considering logic sharing. In which, algebraic balance minimizes delay without increasing area, while NPN based rewrite and DSD based refactor can improve area with level preserving. They work well in most circuits in an interleaved way as in resyn2/dc2 and are also extended to other technology independent representations such as XAGs and MIGs/XMGs.

Therefore, it introduces new global area optimization capability for synthesis and verification, but it requires very high runtime for large-scale graphs even with incremental SAT solving.

Two global (area flow) and local (exact area) area recovery are used to reduce area without level degradation.

        <p class="card-text" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A novel AI4LS mapping operator is proposed by formulating cut sorting heuristics as a multi-class classification problem. CNNs with node and cut embeddings as input are used to learn to sort and filter cuts in technology mapping with the supervised data from mapped delay and area.

        <p class="card-text" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Due to the mis-correlation between logic optimization and technology mapping, an iterative and random area minimization flow helps escape from local minimum. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is utilized to search and randomly select logic optimization operators with the feedback from immediate technology mapping results. Repeating partitioning and merging after each trial may also introduce some optimization opportunities.
