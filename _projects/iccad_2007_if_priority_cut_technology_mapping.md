title: Combinational and Sequential Mapping with Priority Cuts (ICCAD 2007)
description: | 
 Only top-k priority cuts, which are sorted with pre-defined heuristics are saved and more tricks are proposed to reduce the complexity of technology mappings. Two global (area flow) and local (exact area) area recovery are used to reduce area without level degradation.
