title: FRAIGs A Unifying Representation for Logic Synthesis and Verification (2005)
description: | 
 Simulation and SAT solving are utilized to globally check and merge two functional equivalent nodes. Therefore, it introduces new global area optimization capability for synthesis and verification, but it requires very high runtime for large-scale graphs even with incremental SAT solving.
