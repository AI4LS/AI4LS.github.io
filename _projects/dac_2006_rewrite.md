title: DAG-Aware AIG Rewriting A Fresh Look at Combinational Logic Synthesis (DAC 2006)
description: | 
 Three local scalable and effective logic optimization operators are proposed to optimize AIGs considering logic sharing. In which, algebraic balance minimizes delay without increasing area, while NPN based rewrite and DSD based refactor can improve area with level preserving. They work well in most circuits in an interleaved way as in resyn2/dc2 and are also extended to other technology independent representations such as XAGs and MIGs/XMGs.
