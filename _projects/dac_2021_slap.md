title: SLAP: A Supervised Learning Approach for Priority Cuts Technology Mapping (DAC 2021)
description: | 
 A novel AI4LS mapping operator is proposed by formulating cut sorting heuristics as a multi-class classification problem. CNNs with node and cut embeddings as input are used to learn to sort and filter cuts in technology mapping with the supervised data from mapped delay and area.
