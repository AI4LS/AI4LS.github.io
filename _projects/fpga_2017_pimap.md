title: A Parallelized Iterative Improvement Approach to Area Optimization for LUT-Based Technology Mapping (FPGA 2017)
description: | 
 Due to the mis-correlation between logic optimization and technology mapping, an iterative and random area minimization flow helps escape from local minimum. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is utilized to search and randomly select logic optimization operators with the feedback from immediate technology mapping results. Repeating partitioning and merging after each trial may also introduce some optimization opportunities.
