abstract = {Recently, many models show their superiority in sequence and parameter tuning. However, they usually generate non-deterministic flows and require lots of training data. We thus propose a heuristic and iterative flow, namely HIMap, for deterministic logic synthesis. In which, domain knowledge of the functionality and parameters of synthesis operators and their correlations to netlist PPA is fully utilized to design synthesis templates for various objetives. We also introduce deterministic and effective heuristics to tune the templates with relatively fixed operator combinations and iteratively improve netlist PPA. Two nested iterations with local searching and early stopping can thus generate dynamic sequence for various circuits and reduce runtime. HIMap improves 13 best results of the EPFL combinational benchmarks for delay (5 for area). Especially, for several arithmetic benchmarks, HIMap significantly reduces LUT-6 levels by 11.6--21.2% and delay after P&R by 5.0--12.9%.},

abstract = {During the logic synthesis flow of EDA, a sequence of graph transformation operators are applied to the circuits so that the Quality of Results (QoR) of the circuits highly depends on the chosen operators and their specific parameters in the sequence, making the search space operator-dependent and increasingly exponential. In this paper, we formulate the logic synthesis design space exploration as a conditional sequence optimization problem, where at each transformation step, an optimization operator is selected and its corresponding parameters are decided. To solve this problem, we propose a novel sequential black-box optimization approach without human intervention: 1) Due to the conditional and sequential structure of operator sequence with variable length, we build an embedding alignment cells based recurrent neural network as a surrogate model to estimate the QoR of the logic synthesis flow with historical data. 2) With the surrogate model, we construct acquisition function to balance exploration and exploitation with respect to each metric of the QoR. 3) We use multi-objective optimization algorithm to find the Pareto front of the acquisition functions, along which a batch of sequences, consisting of parameterized operators, are (randomly) selected to users for evaluation under the budget of computing resource. We repeat the above three steps until convergence or time limit. Experimental results on public EPFL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the expert-crafted optimization flows and other machine learning based methods. Compared to resyn2, we achieve 11.8% LUT-6 count descent improvements without sacrificing level values.},

While expert-designed operations aid in uncovering effective sequences, the increase in complexity of logic circuits favours automated procedures. To enable efficient and scalable solvers, we propose BOiLS, the first algorithm adapting Bayesian optimisation to navigate the space of synthesis operations. BOiLS requires no human intervention and trades-off exploration versus exploitation through novel Gaussian process kernels and trust-region constrained acquisitions. In a set of experiments on EPFL benchmarks, we demonstrate BOiLS's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art in terms of both sample efficiency and QoR values.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2022 Conference & Exhibition on Design, Automation & Test in Europe}, pages = {1193–1196}, numpages = {4}, keywords = {bayesian optimisation, logic synthesis}, location = {Antwerp, Belgium}, series = {DATE '22},
