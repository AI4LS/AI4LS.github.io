abstract = {Recently, many models show their superiority in sequence and parameter tuning. However, they usually generate non-deterministic flows and require lots of training data. We thus propose a heuristic and iterative flow, namely HIMap, for deterministic logic synthesis. In which, domain knowledge of the functionality and parameters of synthesis operators and their correlations to netlist PPA is fully utilized to design synthesis templates for various objetives. We also introduce deterministic and effective heuristics to tune the templates with relatively fixed operator combinations and iteratively improve netlist PPA. Two nested iterations with local searching and early stopping can thus generate dynamic sequence for various circuits and reduce runtime. HIMap improves 13 best results of the EPFL combinational benchmarks for delay (5 for area). Especially, for several arithmetic benchmarks, HIMap significantly reduces LUT-6 levels by 11.6--21.2% and delay after P&R by 5.0--12.9%.},

abstract = {During the logic synthesis flow of EDA, a sequence of graph transformation operators are applied to the circuits so that the Quality of Results (QoR) of the circuits highly depends on the chosen operators and their specific parameters in the sequence, making the search space operator-dependent and increasingly exponential. In this paper, we formulate the logic synthesis design space exploration as a conditional sequence optimization problem, where at each transformation step, an optimization operator is selected and its corresponding parameters are decided. To solve this problem, we propose a novel sequential black-box optimization approach without human intervention: 1) Due to the conditional and sequential structure of operator sequence with variable length, we build an embedding alignment cells based recurrent neural network as a surrogate model to estimate the QoR of the logic synthesis flow with historical data. 2) With the surrogate model, we construct acquisition function to balance exploration and exploitation with respect to each metric of the QoR. 3) We use multi-objective optimization algorithm to find the Pareto front of the acquisition functions, along which a batch of sequences, consisting of parameterized operators, are (randomly) selected to users for evaluation under the budget of computing resource. We repeat the above three steps until convergence or time limit. Experimental results on public EPFL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the expert-crafted optimization flows and other machine learning based methods. Compared to resyn2, we achieve 11.8% LUT-6 count descent improvements without sacrificing level values.},

abstract = {Optimising the quality-of-results (QoR) of circuits during logic synthesis is a formidable challenge necessitating the exploration of exponentially sized search spaces. While expert-designed operations aid in uncovering effective sequences, the increase in complexity of logic circuits favours automated procedures. To enable efficient and scalable solvers, we propose BOiLS, the first algorithm adapting Bayesian optimisation to navigate the space of synthesis operations. BOiLS requires no human intervention and trades-off exploration versus exploitation through novel Gaussian process kernels and trust-region constrained acquisitions. In a set of experiments on EPFL benchmarks, we demonstrate BOiLS's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art in terms of both sample efficiency and QoR values.},

abstract = {Gate Sizing is an important step in logic synthesis, where the cells are resized to optimize metrics such as area, timing, power, leakage, etc. In this work, we consider the gate sizing problem for leakage power optimization with timing constraints. Lagrangian Relaxation is a widely employed optimization method for gate sizing problems. We accelerate Lagrangian Relaxation-based algorithms by narrowing down the range of cells to resize. In particular, we formulate a heterogeneous directed graph to represent the timing graph, propose a heterogeneous graph neural network as the encoder, and train in the way of imitation learning to mimic the selection behavior of each iteration in Lagrangian Relaxation. This network is used to predict the set of cells that need to be changed during the optimization process of Lagrangian Relaxation. Experiments show that our accelerated gate sizer could achieve comparable performance to the baseline with an average of 22.5% runtime reduction.},

abstract = {Technology mapping quality heavily depends on the subject graph structure. To overcome structural biases, operators construct choice nodes to enable mappings with improved node and level counts. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art structural choice operators scale poorly with graph size. We present the lightweight structural choices (LCH) operator that incorporates equivalencies by processing only subparts of the graph. We propose multiple heuristics that rely on specific node extraction orders and subpart sizes to extract non-overlapping components. Compared to state-of-the-art methods on EPFL circuits, LCH is 2.35x faster enduring a small sacrifice in node count (3%) and level reduction (2%).

abstract = {Circuit partitioning is a critical step in hardware-assisted functional verification that involves splitting a circuit into multiple partitions and assigning them to specific hardware. However, partitioning a large circuit can require considerable computation resources and time, especially when complex hardware constraints are involved. Moreover, the path delay after partitioning can have a significant impact on verification efficiency, making early path delay prediction crucial for refining the circuit effectively. In this work, we propose a novel circuit partitioning predictor, named CPP, to rapidly and accu- rately predict the path delay after partitioning. To achieve this, we use circuit coarsening to develop a multi-level path representation and employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can capture both local and global path structures for delay prediction. Through extensive experiments on large industrial circuits, we demonstrate the superiority of our prediction framework.},

abstract = {Rewriting is a widely used logic optimization ap- proach incorporated in most commercial logic synthesis tools. In this paper, we present a new rewriting method based on And- Inverted Graph (AIG). Rather than focusing on cut rewriting, it considers a novel sub-structure called Maximum Fanout-Free Window (MFFW) and rewrites with a more compact imple- mentation. Both exact synthesis and heuristic methods can be adopted to optimize MFFWs. A database dependent framework is proposed to store the optimal sub-structures to accelerate the processing. We further propose the semi-canonicalization to reduce the scale of the database, which could reduce more than 98% of the 4-input MFFW database. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework.},
